# Tree
This Repository contains programs of Trees in Java, which contains programs of Kruskal, Prim & other algorithms as well as other methods for spanning tree & implementing methods of Binary Search Tree for better understanding the trees, method & working of tree in programs.

## Programs Description:
1. Program 1: Program to find Minimal spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal’s algorithm. 
2. Program 2: Program to find Minimal spanning tree of a graph using Prim’s algorithm.
3. Program 3: Program using functions for binary tree traversals Pre-order, In-order and Post-order using any Recursive and Non-recursive approach.
4. Program 4: Implement following functions for Binary Search Trees
- Search a given item 
- Insertion of a new node 
- Maximum element of the BST 
- Minimum element of the BST 
- Successor of the BST 
- Delete a given node from the BST
5. Program 5: Implementation of AVL tree with operations (search, insert and delete).
  
## Features
- Kruskal's Algorithm: Minimal spannig tree of graph was made using Kruskal's algorithm.
- Prim's Algorithm: Minimal spannig tree of graph was made using Prim's algorithm.
- Binary Search Tree: A number of functions are made in binary tree traversing and tree itself.
- Recursion: Few of the methods are made with the logic of recursion.
- Time Complexity: By using the method of recursion, compilation is made in least possible run-time.
- Efficient: Recursion reduces runtime complexity as well as seperate functions are made to run program more efficiently.
